# LOAN APPROVAL DATA
### This project focuses on analyzing loan data to uncover trends and insights that could assist in understanding loan performance and its broader economic impact. 
### The dataset includes various attributes such as loan amounts, business types, job creation, and retention figures, along with key indicators like franchise codes and urban/rural classification. 
### Through statistical analysis, we examine the distribution of loan terms and how they relate to employment outcomes. The project aims to identify patterns that could guide decision-making for future loan approvals and economic development initiatives.
